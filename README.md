LuxTTS is an lightweight zipvoice based text-to-speech model designed for high quality voice cloning and realistic generation at speeds exceeding 150x realtime.

### The main features are
- Voice cloning: SOTA voice cloning on par with models 10x larger.
- Clarity: Clear 48khz speech generation unlike most TTS models which are limited to 24khz.
- Speed: Reaches speeds of 150x realtime on a single GPU and faster then realtime on CPU's as well.
- Efficiency: Fits within 1gb vram meaning it can fit in any local gpu.

## Usage

#### Simple installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/ysharma3501/LuxTTS.git
cd LuxTTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Load model:
```python
from zipvoice.luxtts import LuxTTS
lux_tts = LuxTTS('YatharthS/LuxTTS', device='cuda', threads=2) ## change device to cpu for cpu usage
```

#### Simple inference
```python
from IPython.display import Audio

text = "Hey, what's up? I'm feeling really great if you ask me honestly!"
prompt_audio = 'audio_file.wav'

## encode audio(takes 10s to init because of librosa first time)
encoded_prompt = lux_tts.encode_prompt(prompt_audio, rms=rms)

## generate speech
final_wav = lux_tts.generate_speech(text, encoded_prompt, num_steps=num_steps)

## display speech
display(Audio(final_wav, rate=48000))
```

#### Inference with sampling params:
```python
from IPython.display import Audio

text = "Hey, what's up? I'm feeling really great if you ask me honestly!"
prompt_audio = 'audio_file.wav'

rms = 0.01 ## higher makes it sound louder(0.01 or so recommended)
t_shift = 0.9 ## sampling param, higher can sound better but worse WER
num_steps = 4 ## sampling param, higher sounds better but takes longer(3-4 is best for efficiency)
speed = 1.0 ## sampling param, controls speed of audio(lower=faster)
return_smooth = False ## sampling param, makes it sound smoother possibly but less cleaner

## encode audio(takes 10s to init because of librosa first time)
encoded_prompt = lux_tts.encode_prompt(prompt_audio, rms=rms)

## generate speech
final_wav = lux_tts.generate_speech(text, encoded_prompt, num_steps=num_steps, t_shift=t_shift, speed=speed, return_smooth=return_smooth)

## display speech
display(Audio(final_wav, rate=48000))
```
## Tips
- Please use at minimum a 3 second audio file for voice cloning.
- You can use return_smooth = True if you hear metallic sounds.
- Lower t_shift for less possible pronunciation errors but worse quality and vice versa.

  
## Info

Q: How is this different from ZipVoice?

A: LuxTTS uses the same architecture but distilled to 4 steps with an improved sampling technique. It also uses a custom 48khz vocoder instead of the default 24khz version.

Q: Can it be even faster?

A: Yes, currently it uses float32. Float16 should be significantly faster(almost 2x).

## Roadmap

- [x] Release model and code
- [ ] Huggingface spaces demo
- [ ] Release code for float16 inference
